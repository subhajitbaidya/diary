# Dear Diary ‚Äì A Safe Space for Your Emotions

---

## üí¨ About the Project

As we grow deeper into the immersive digital world, we all face a struggle with unsaid emotions. That‚Äôs what inspired the creation of **Dear Diary** ‚Äî a simple web based diary where users can safely **vent their thoughts and feelings** without judgment. If everything can become digital, why not this too?

## üéØ Vision & Purpose

- üå± **Human-Centric Motivation:**
  I'm passionate about building something that genuinely helps people. This app is my step toward **making tech more human**.

- üíñ **A Safe Space:**
  Dear Diary is designed to be a **comfort zone**, a digital shoulder to lean on, where users can express themselves without fear.

- üîê **Privacy & Consent First:**
  I‚Äôm committed to **handling user data responsibly**, ensuring nothing is stored without the user's **explicit consent**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Highlights

- üß™ **Development Version**
  This repo will track the **entire journey** ‚Äî from idea to implementation.

- üß± **Built on Small, Practical Ideas**
  We‚Äôll start with **basic core features**, ensuring simplicity, and then expand organically.

- üõÅ **Microservices Architecture in Future**
  The app will evolve to a **Microservice-based system**, including:

  - üìå Basic API Gateway
  - üìå Separate Service Modules (Auth, Diary, Logging, etc.)
  - üìå Scalable and maintainable codebase

- üíª **Frontend Migration Planned**
  The current UI will eventually be upgraded to frameworks like **React** for a smoother user experience.

## üöÄ How to Run

> Prerequisite: Node Js and Code Editor of your choice
> If using VS code, install extensions like live server, prettier code formatter

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhajitbaidya/diary.git
# Run Front End locally in your browser
cd diary
"Open with Live Server"
# Run server in dev environment
cd diary
cd server
npm init -y
npm install
npm run dev

```

## ü™í Learnings

- For interacting with data from front end to back end, we need to configure CORS.
- I am following an SPA approach for this app. Therefore, the components are dynamically rendered.
- Display quotes from an external API.
- Chat box for interacting with an ML model

---

## ü™í Things to Learn

‚úÖ What Is SPA?
A Single Page Application dynamically updates the content of a single HTML page without refreshing or navigating to different files.

- Loads index.html once.
- Uses JavaScript to show/hide different "pages" (sections).
- Communicates with the backend via fetch or XMLHttpRequest.

‚úÖ Benefits of This Approach:

- No page reloads.
- Simpler navigation experience.
- Great for small to medium projects.

üß† Things to implement:

- Adding localStorage or sessionStorage to persist login.
- Dynamically injecting HTML with JavaScript (instead of hiding/showing).
- Using history.pushState() for URL changes without reload.

---

‚úÖ 2. JWT Authentication Flow of Login/Sign up

- Generate tokens in backend
- Verify the token
- Return the token in cookies or headers

Sign up/Login Handler:

- Check if user exists
- If not, create and store in MongoDB
- Generate JWT and send it in cookie
- Implement middleware to protect routes

‚úÖ 4. First-Time User Flow

- On sign up: check if email exists in DB.
- If not: create user, set JWT, redirect/render main app.

## üß† Challenges I faced while developing

Problem: I was doing this `<span id="toggletext">Don't have an account? <a href="#" id="toggleLink">Sign up</a> </span>` and modifying it with Javascript which was not preserving the link from the anchor tag. The solution is to bind the event listener in a function.

üîÅ Why we Need to Rebind the Event Listener?

toggleText.innerHTML = `Already have an account? <a href="#" id="toggleLink">Login</a>`;

Replacing the entire content of the #toggletext element, including the `<a>` tag inside it. This means:

- The original `<a id="toggleLink">` is destroyed and replaced with a new one.
- JavaScript event listeners are not preserved when elements are recreated like this.
- So even though the new HTML looks the same visually, it‚Äôs a completely new DOM element without any event attached.

üîß Rebinding Is Needed Because:

- JavaScript does not automatically attach event listeners to newly created elements. That‚Äôs why after modifying .innerHTML, you need to do this again:

`document.getElementById("toggleLink").addEventListener("click", toggleLoginSignup);`

- We will follow a monolith strangle approach
